u can mirror on X, Y or both by using a Stretch Layer. Set its amount parameter accordingly.
X mirror: (1, -1)
Y mirror: (-1,1)
X&Y mirror: (-1,-1)
If you need to do a rotated mirror use a rotate layer later and link the origin of the rotation to the origin of stretch. 
5. Import from library, then copy and paste objects.
