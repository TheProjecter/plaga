Plague is an animation series in 2D. It is based on a short story I wrote a couple of years ago and I reviewing lately. It is a futuristic story that I'm planning to animate in 13 chapters of around 2 minutes each. All the animation will be done using Synfig Studio.

Initially, the animation and all the other material will be in Spanish. Subtitles, translations and doubling are, however, welcome.
